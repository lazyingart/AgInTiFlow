# Supervision Campaign Ledger

Continuous AgInTiFlow validation uses a SQLite ledger instead of relying on a
chat transcript. The ledger records capability coverage, realistic scenarios,
individual test runs, runtime events, reusable fixes, versions, session IDs,
tmux ownership, and external evidence.

Initialize a campaign:

```bash
node scripts/supervision-ledger.js init \
  --db /path/to/campaign.sqlite \
  --campaign general-capability \
  --objective "Make AgInTiFlow fast, robust, and generally capable" \
  --aginti-version "$(node -p \"require('./package.json').version\")"
```

Register coverage before testing:

```bash
node scripts/supervision-ledger.js capability \
  --db /path/to/campaign.sqlite --campaign general-capability \
  --id media-chain --domain media --subdomain music-video-publish \
  --description "Reuse Musia, LALACHAN, and LazyEdit without rebuilding them" \
  --priority 90

node scripts/supervision-ledger.js scenario \
  --db /path/to/campaign.sqlite --campaign general-capability \
  --id media-chain-readiness --domain media --profile auto \
  --prompt-quality normal \
  --prompt "Inspect the established media chain without generating or publishing." \
  --expected-outputs '["media-routine-readiness.md"]' \
  --validation "Verify exact routine paths, command help, artifact bytes, and zero external writes."
```

Create, start, and finish a concrete run with `test`, `start`, `event`, and
`finish`. Record a reusable product change with `fix`. Every command is an
idempotent or append-only SQLite operation suitable for a persistent tmux
campaign.

Test registration validates that any named capability and scenario belong to
the same campaign. Finishing a test updates the test, capability, and scenario
status in one SQLite transaction, so a typo cannot silently leave the campaign
matrix stale or split across contradictory states.

Inspect current coverage:

```bash
node scripts/supervision-ledger.js status \
  --db /path/to/campaign.sqlite --campaign general-capability
```

Do not mark a test passed from the agent's prose. Verify session events, files,
checks, external state, and side-effect boundaries first, then store those paths
in `evidence_json` and `events`.

## Current Campaign Findings

### Data analysis retained-state recovery

`data-analysis-local-011` passed after reusable runtime fixes. AgInTi completed
the mixed sensor-export project, repaired its own unclosed CSV handles, created
commits `2f79553` and `3317a59`, and resumed the same durable session after a
control-loop pause. Independent validation ran both the unit suite and the
canonical generator with `ResourceWarning` promoted to an error; all tests,
audit counts, condition means, plot bytes, and clean-git checks passed.

The incident established two general contracts:

- A canonical command wrapped only by an explicit exit-status probe, such as
  `python analysis.py; echo "EXIT=$?"`, is valid evidence when the captured
  status is zero. Arbitrary semicolon chains remain invalid because a later
  command can hide an earlier failure.
- User-facing artifacts keep canonical workspace paths but receive a readable
  canvas/download filename derived from the task title and source purpose.
  Internal collision identifiers are short suffixes, never the leading or only
  visible filename information.

### QA repair continuity and evidence intent

`qa-incident-metrics-001` passed after two reusable runtime fixes. A normal,
underspecified QA prompt led the DeepSeek-backed agent to reproduce and diagnose
compound-duration parsing, percentile interpolation/mutation, and deterministic
summary-order defects. The first partial patch advanced the mutation revision,
but the runtime then forgot the retained failing test and prematurely reduced
the tool surface to test-only mode. Source-next restored the failed-test repair
state until a fresh current-revision test passed, allowing the same durable
session to finish the coherent patch, add regressions, run 15 tests at 100%
statement coverage, clean debris, and commit `667891f`.

Independent `pytest` and the hidden `qa_incident_metrics_contract.py` checker
both passed. The run also exposed an evidence-intent false positive: `figure
out` and `clean up generated test debris` were interpreted as a request for a
canvas artifact. Evidence inference now excludes those non-production phrases
while retaining the artifact gate for real generated figures. Exact session
evidence remains in
`~/.agintiflow/sessions/aginti-qa-incident-metrics-001/events.jsonl` and the
machine ledger records the run as `passed_after_fix`.

### GitHub maintenance hidden acceptance and goal-scoped evidence

`github-safe-maintenance-012` started from a normal maintenance prompt rather
than a checker-shaped instruction. The agent repaired and verified the target,
but its first completion omitted the exact `docs/maintenance-handoff.md` file
required by independent acceptance. The same retained session inspected the
external failure, created the missing handoff, committed and pushed target
commit `36fa6c0`, and left `main` clean and synchronized. The hidden
`github_maintenance_contract.py` checker then passed.

Supervision of the repair exposed four runtime defects that could affect other
profiles:

- A test command wrapped as `command; echo "EXIT:$?"` could have shell exit zero
  even when the real command failed. Explicit final `EXIT`, `STATUS`, or
  `RESULT` probes are now parsed; a missing or nonzero marker is failing
  evidence.
- A genuinely new continuation could inherit completed artifact, SCS,
  project-verification, and repair state from the prior goal. New goals now
  clear only goal-scoped execution evidence while preserving conversation,
  durable goal history, and goal-keyed research memory.
- An acceptance sentence listing screenshots, PDFs, reports, or app launches
  "as appropriate" could force irrelevant visual work. Optional evidence
  examples no longer become mandatory categories.
- Merely naming a read-only checker such as `contract.py` could force a file
  artifact. File evidence now requires both mutation intent and a workspace
  file/source target; a virtual canvas artifact remains artifact evidence only.

The patched source resumed `aginti-github-maintenance-001`, invoked the hidden
checker exactly once, performed no file, canvas, commit, or push side effect,
and completed with a clean repository-state check. The full npm suite and the
focused dynamic-budget, SCS/model-role, and web-canvas regressions pass for
AgInTiFlow `0.20.213`.
